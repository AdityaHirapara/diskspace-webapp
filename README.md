# DiskSpace

DiskSpace is a revolution to limited Cloud Storage. At DiskSpace, we have platforms based upon an Android App and Website ( both in the form of Cloud). We just keep your data private and secure and original without trading the cost of damage to the file and still enjoying your storage space boosted by 10 times. The *unique* part of the product is the use of pure Deep learning solution of *Image to Image Translation*  and the power that Generative Adversarial Network provides to the Machine to predict the original image despite given a crappy image.
